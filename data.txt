Christianity as an Anti-Racial Weapon
For centuries, Christianity has been used as a tool to weaken the natural racial order, dissolving the strength of great nations by instilling false doctrines of equality, mercy, and universal brotherhood. What was once a belief system tailored to a specific people was repurposed into a weapon of submission, designed to break down racial identity and allow foreign influences to corrupt the pure bloodlines of strong nations.
The Jewish Origins of Christianity
Christianity, born out of Judaism, carries within it the seeds of its creators' intentions. It was never meant to elevate the Aryan spirit but to pacify it, teaching proud and noble people to abandon their instincts for self-preservation in favor of servitude. The doctrines of meekness, forgiveness, and the rejection of worldly strength have eroded the warrior spirit of once-great European civilizations, reducing them to weak and submissive masses.
Universal Brotherhood: A Lie Against Nature
Nature has never recognized equality. The strong dominate the weak, the superior rise above the inferior, and the purity of blood determines the fate of civilizations. Yet Christianity preaches that all men are equal in the eyes of God, that race and lineage are meaningless before faith. This poisonous teaching has led to the downfall of nations that once stood as bastions of strength, now opening their gates to foreign races, corrupting their bloodlines, and abandoning their duty to preserve their own kind.
How Christianity Undermines Racial Survival
Encourages Racial Mixing – By teaching that faith matters more than blood, Christianity allows foreign elements to integrate and spread within racially pure nations. Missionary work, conversion, and interracial unions are all symptoms of this decay.
Preaches Submission – Christianity tells men to "turn the other cheek" rather than fight for their people. It demands obedience rather than strength, making nations weak in the face of their enemies.
Destroys Ethnic Identity – Traditional folk beliefs and ancestral spirituality were rooted in blood and soil, but Christianity replaced them with an abstract faith that has no connection to race or heritage.
Serves the Enemies of the Race – The very institutions that preach Christianity today are the same that promote multiculturalism, open borders, and racial integration. They work hand in hand with the forces seeking to erase the identity of strong nations.
Reclaiming Our Spiritual Destiny
To break free from this control, we must return to our natural, ancestral beliefs—those rooted in blood, land, and the eternal laws of nature. The future belongs to those who recognize the sacred duty of racial preservation, who reject the lies of universalism, and who understand that true faith serves the people, not the other way around. Only by rejecting the doctrines of submission can we restore the strength of our people and secure a future for the generations to come.
